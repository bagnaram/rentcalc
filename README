Rentcalc

A simple utility to tabulate and generate rent reports. Very useful in room-mate situations where you want to make clear the current bills. As a bonus, it creates a graphical line graph representation of your bills so you can track the monthly costs.

Generation is easy. Simply prepend a listing of bills, one per line. Order is important.
